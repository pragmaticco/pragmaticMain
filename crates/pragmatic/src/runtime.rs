//! The **Runtime** — record, resume, replay.
//!
//! Wrap your agent in a closure over [`Ctx`], hand it to the runtime under a
//! stable run id, and every oracle call, effect, receive, and clock read is
//! journaled as the run proceeds:
//!
//! ```
//! use pragmatic::{Runtime, SeededOracle};
//!
//! let mut rt = Runtime::in_memory(SeededOracle::new(42));
//! let report = rt.run("run-1", |ctx| {
//!     let plan = ctx.oracle("plan the task")?;
//!     let step = ctx.oracle(format!("execute: {plan}"))?;
//!     Ok(format!("done: {step}").into())
//! }).unwrap();
//!
//! // Crash anywhere; `resume` replays the journaled prefix (no model calls)
//! // and continues recording at the tail.
//! // Replay the whole run later, exactly — the model is never consulted.
//! let audit = rt.replay("run-1", |ctx| {
//!     let plan = ctx.oracle("plan the task")?;
//!     let step = ctx.oracle(format!("execute: {plan}"))?;
//!     Ok(format!("done: {step}").into())
//! }).unwrap();
//! assert_eq!(report.trace, audit.trace); // T1, empirically
