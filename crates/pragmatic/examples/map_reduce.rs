//! Case study CS1 (paper §6.2): **map-reduce summarization** across
//! coordinated runs, with per-agent recovery.
//!
//! Three mapper runs each summarize a shard; a reducer run receives their
//! summaries over channels and synthesizes the final answer. Every receive
//! is journaled, so when one mapper crashes it recovers from *its own*
//! journal without unwinding the others - and the reducer replays exactly.
//!
//! ```sh
//! cargo run -p pragmatic --example map_reduce
//! ```
