# Product strategy

*Last revised: 2026-08-08. This document is the durable record of what
Pragmatic is betting on, so that roadmap decisions stay consistent across
releases. Change it deliberately, in a PR, with reasoning.*

## The one-sentence position

Pragmatic is the **black-box recorder for LLM agents**: crash recovery that
never re-pays for a token, and a tamper-evident journal that proves what an
agent actually did.

## The wedge (decided 2026-08)

We lead with **auditability** - tamper-evident, bit-for-bit replay of agent
runs - with **zero-token crash recovery** as the supporting economic
benefit. Rationale:

- Crash recovery alone is contestable: generic durable-execution engines
  (Temporal, Restate, Inngest, DBOS) deliver a good-enough version of it by
  caching activity outputs. We are better in kind, but the buyer feels the
  difference only at the margin.
- Auditability is not contested: no engine treats run history as an audit
  artifact (hash-chained, HMAC-keyed, exportable, replayable with the model
  provably never consulted). Teams deploying agents in regulated or
  high-stakes settings have this problem, budget for it, and no incumbent
  to displace.
- The formal results (T1 mechanized in Lean) are the *credibility backing*
  for the audit claim - not the headline. Buyers don't purchase theorems;
  they purchase "we can answer the auditor."

The README leads with these two pains, in that order. Marketing, docs, and
demos should do the same.

## Who it's for

1. **Design partners (now):** teams running multi-step agents in production
   who have been burned by (a) a long run dying and re-billing, or (b) an
   incident review that couldn't reconstruct what the agent did. Regulated
   industries (fin-serv, health, legal) are the sharpest version of (b).
2. **Later:** platform teams standardizing how their org runs agents, once
   the hosted console exists.

## Roadmap priorities, in order

1. **Prove the abstraction on real agents.** Done for Anthropic (v0.5:
   structured `Conversation`/`Turn` tool-use loop, wire-tested end to end).
   Next: the same structured-conversation surface for `pragmatic-openai`,
   so tool-loop agents are portable across both adapters.
2. **TypeScript SDK as a first-class citizen.** Agents live in Python and
   TypeScript. The koffi-based Node binding is a proof of the C ABI, not a
   DX. A real TS package (typed `Conversation`/`Turn`, promise-native ctx,
   npm-installable with prebuilt binaries) is the next major surface.
3. **Minimal hosted console for design partners.** The commercial layer.
   Journal upload/sync + the existing console UI + retention policy +
   alerting on chain breaks and dangling effects. Ship embarrassingly
   small, to 2–3 design partners with a real compliance need; let their
   usage set the packaging and pricing.
4. **Only then:** breadth (more adapters, more bindings, distributed
   journals).

## What we are deliberately NOT doing

- **No new language bindings.** C++ / Java / Go / Node bindings are
  **stable, maintenance-only** as of v0.4: they track the C ABI, get bug
  fixes and CI, and do not grow new surface ahead of the core. They exist
  to prove the ABI and serve embedding use cases - not to chase every
  runtime. (Revisit only on concrete customer demand.)
- **No agent framework.** Pragmatic is the runtime under whatever framework
  the user already has. We do not ship planners, memory stores, or prompt
  tooling beyond what journaling requires.
- **No distributed journal until a customer needs it.** Single-process
  local-disk journals are the honest scope; the hosted layer changes
  operations, not semantics.
- **No benchmark-chasing.** The "Measured, not promised" table grows only
  when a claim matters to the wedge.

## Positioning FAQ

**Why not Temporal?** If you run Temporal for general workflows, keep it.
Pragmatic is for when the agent itself must be recoverable and auditable:
the model call is modeled (not an opaque cached activity), a changed agent
fails loudly at cursor 0 instead of diverging silently, and the journal is
an exportable, tamper-evident audit artifact rather than engine-internal
state. Full table in the README.

**Why BSL and not Apache?** The commercial layer is hosted journaling; BSL
prevents a cloud vendor from shipping it first while keeping the runtime
free for effectively everyone (< $1M revenue, non-production, and every
release converts to Apache 2.0 after four years).

**Why zero dependencies in the core?** The runtime asks to be linked into
someone's production agent. Every transitive dependency is a reason to say
no. Adapters may carry the minimum to speak HTTPS + JSON.

## Signals that the strategy is working

- Design-partner conversations start from the audit story, not the retry
  story.
- A journal HTML export gets attached to a real incident ticket.
- The first commercial-license conversation is pulled by the hosted
  console, not pushed by us.

## Signals to revisit

- Incumbents ship first-class LLM-call modeling with audit-grade history.
- Design partners consistently ask for recovery/cost and shrug at audit -
  then the wedge order flips.
